# Identify Potential Charity Donors with Supervised Learning
Our client (CharityML) had observed that every donation they received in the past came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually.  These individuals are classified as high potential donors.  Our goal here is to create supervised machine learning models to help predict whether an individual makes above this threshold based on attributes such as: *age* , *working class*, *level of education*, *marital status*, *occupation*, *relationship*, *race*, *sex*, *monetary capital*, *average hours worked per week*, and *native country*.
